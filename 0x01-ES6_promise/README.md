### ES6 - Promises

Here in this project I am going to explore and get hands on practice on JS ES6 Promise, Await, Async and Throw/Try.

# Throughout of the project I am expected to learn and explain to anyone:

<ul>
<li>Promises (how, why, and what)</li>
<li>How to use the then, resolve, catch methods</li>
<li>How to use every method of the Promise object</li>
<li>Throw / Try</li>
<li>The await operator</li>
<li>How to use an async function</li>
</ul>

## Definitions:

<ul>
<li>The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.</li>

<li>The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.</li>

<li>The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. The await keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.</li>
</ul>
