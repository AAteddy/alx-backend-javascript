# TypeScript

Here in this project I will be learning and get hands-on practice on TypeScript language.

### Definition:

TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.
TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.

### Learning Outcomes:

<ul>
<li> Basic types in Typescript</li>
<li>Interfaces, Classes, and functions</li>
<li>How to work with the DOM and Typescript</li>
<li>Generic types</li>
<li>How to use namespaces</li>
<li>How to merge declarations</li>
<li>How to use an ambient Namespace to import an external library</li>
<li>Basic nominal typing with Typescript</li>
</ul>
