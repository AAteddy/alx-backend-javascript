# ES6 classes

Here in this project, I will be using ES6 to learn and practice on JS Classes and JS Metaprogramming.
Through out this project I will be expected to understand and explain briefly, also get hands-on practical experience on the following:

<ul>
<li>How to define a Class</li>
<li>How to add methods to a class</li>
<li>Why and how to add a static method to a class</li>
<li>How to extend a class from another</li>
<li>Metaprogramming and symbols</li>
</ul>

## Definition:

### ES6 Class:

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes are in fact "special functions".
